This module is an extension for Sphinx. It defines a role :hover: which takes a single string argument of the form `arg1,arg2`. 

In the Sphinx-generated HTML code the string 'arg1' is highlighted and will provide a translation of the string 'arg2' to English (from Icelandic) on mouse-over based on the stae.is/os database (stored locally in 'ordasafn.py'). If no comma is found in the argument, 'arg2' is assumed to be the same as 'arg1'.

In Sphinx-generated Latex code, 'arg1' is simply made italic.

Example:
========
Ef gefinn er rétthyrndur þríhyrningur segir reglan til um að ef lögð eru saman önnur veldi :hover:`skammhliða,skammhlið` þríhyrningsins jafngildi sú summa öðru :hover:`veldi` langhliðarinnar.

Installation:
=============
1. Navigate to the folder containing this README file.
2. Run the following commands:
	>>python setup.py build
	>>sudo python setup.py install
3. Move 'layout.html' to your '_templates' directory. If there already exists a custom layout file then copy the contents of 'layout.html' to that file.
4. Add 'hoverrole.hoverrole' to your extensions in 'conf.py'

Planned additions:
==================
- Currently the extension provides a single translation of 'arg2'. If an exact match is found in the database it is used. Otherwise, the first term containing 'arg2' is used. Options should be implemented to configure if more translations should be provided and if related terms and word class should be shown.
- The extension does not support English to Icelandic translation (although ordaskra.py does). A possible (and easy) solution is: In case of no is-to-en translation found, try en-to-is. This solution has the downside that when is-to-en translation fails (e.g. in case of typo) a en-to-is translation may be provided instead without the user noticing.
- List of translated terms for the whole document.
