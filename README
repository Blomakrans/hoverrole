This module is an extension for Sphinx. It defines a role :hover: which takes a single string argument of the form `arg1,arg2`. 

In the Sphinx-generated HTML code the string 'arg1' is highlighted and will provide a translation of the string 'arg2' to English (from Icelandic) on mouse-over based on the stae.is/os database (stored locally in 'ordasafn.py'). If no comma is found in the argument, 'arg2' is assumed to be the same as 'arg1'.

In the Sphinx-generated Latex code 'arg1' can be italicized or made to contain a link to a stae.is translation of the term 'arg2'.

The extension recognizes the following user settings which can be set in conf.py:
hover_numOfTranslations, default:'single' , changing this to 'all' will include all matches found
in the dictionary instead of only the top one.
hover_htmlLinkToStae, default 1, change to 0 if mouse-over in HTML should not link to stae.is translation.
hover_latexItText, default 1, change to 0 if Latex text should not be italicized.
hover_latexLinkToStae, default 0, change to 1 if Latex text should link to stae.is translation. Overrides latexItText.

Example:
========
Ef gefinn er rétthyrndur þríhyrningur segir reglan til um að ef lögð eru saman önnur veldi :hover:`skammhliða,skammhlið` þríhyrningsins jafngildi sú summa öðru :hover:`veldi` langhliðarinnar.

Installation:
=============
1. Navigate to the folder containing this README file.
2. Run the following commands:
	>>python setup.py build
	>>sudo python setup.py install
3. Move 'layout.html' to your '_templates' directory. If there already exists a custom layout file then copy the contents of 'layout.html' to that file.
4. Add 'hoverrole.hoverrole' to your extensions in 'conf.py'

Planned additions:
==================
- Support for other dictionaries.
- The extension does not support English to Icelandic translation (although ordaskra.py does). A possible (and easy) solution is: In case of no is-to-en translation found, try en-to-is. This solution has the downside that when is-to-en translation fails (e.g. in case of typo) a en-to-is translation may be provided instead without the user noticing.
- List of translated terms for the whole document.
